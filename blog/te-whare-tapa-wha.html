      <p>
        The below is my approach to Te Whare Tapa Wha, to become more aware of my physical, mental, spiritual and family well-being.

      <h2>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        Initially when I started this learning plan, I wrote about managing my endometriosis. However, the forefront of my tinana wellbeing plan is rest after getting a hysterectomy. 
        <ul>
          <li>Walking for 5 minutes 3 times per day</li>
          <li>Eating a moderate fiber diet</li>
          <li>No alcohol</li>
          <li>Sleeping when required (even if it’s a work day)</li>
          <li>Taking medication on time</li>
          <li>Monitoring how my body feels, noting any changes</li>
          <li>Limiting interactions with people outside of my house to avoid masking exhaustion (e.g. seeing friends, events, colleagues limited) until I am able to build back up slowly based on energy levels</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest stressor at the moment, is not being to do what I usually do. It has affected my emotional and mental wellbeing because I have to depend on others, something which does not come naturally to me. 

        As a way to ease this, I have had to confront any intrusive or negative thoughts by speaking them out loud with my wife or bestie. The reassurance helps, along with the reminder that ‘you just had surgery!’. 
      
        Being behind on coursework has also been a bit guilt inducing, especially missing home groups. But I am trying to communicate better rather than feeling guilt or shame. It’s still a work in progress (thank you for your patience and aroha Lani)
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        I strongly believe I carry guides with me every day, and I have to be at peace to hear their guidance. This means slowing down, watching for the signs, listening to my body etc. 
        Spiritual wellbeing is a new thing for me, kind of like a side mission for 2023 and I have really leaned into it. 
        We are constantly presented with options whether we know it or not, I recently said to my wife “I always seem to get things into twos” to which they replied “My mum always says we are always presented with two doors”. Those guides I mentioned, help me create an environment so when I am presented with those two doors, I know which one is stronger for me to choose.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>
        Communication is important for me at the moment rather than kanohi te kanoti (face to face). I have established a daily check in with my wife to make sure they are feeling okay and not too overwhelmed running day to day tasks on their own. I also try to spend quality time with them watching shows and actively listening how their day at work went. 
        I spend time with my best friend who is also my flatmate, seeing her every few days is a saving grace for me, she always makes me laugh (nearly popped a stitch in doing so haha). 
      </p>

      <h2>Whenua (land)</h2>
      <p>
        I am missing the whenua a lot at the moment. But I do have my cat for cuddles and two polish chickens which are just hilarious to sit and watch. 
        Usually I like to go for daily walks at a park close to my whare, usually every morning while I listen to a podcast. This will start again when I am a bit more able bodied.
