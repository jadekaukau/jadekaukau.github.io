             <p><em><b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</b></em></p>
             <p>I can’t provide full detail on the ethical decisions that come to mind, however when these do come up, I tend to sit with them for a while to process my feelings. I need to weigh up feelings, values, relationships and possible consequences, including consequences that will affect me personally or my wider interpersonal relationships. 
              The decisions I think of, some of them I have not done the above and instead ran purely on emotional reaction. When I reflect on decisions like this, they never turn out positive, there is always something or someone in the firing line. 
              I learned to remove emotion and aim to be as objective as possible to begin, consider bias, what unconscious bias could I hold. I then start thinking of possible solutions that could lead to outcomes, which usually lead to considering emotions of people involved.
              </p>
             <p><em><b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b></em></p> 
             <p>Oh my gosh, so much has been added! I’m so lucky to be a part of many different cultures and have such wonderful people in my life. 
              My Maori culture is a central part of my identity, so is being a part of the rainbow community. This has been influenced by so many things, family, access to communities and honestly, the ability to search for things online!

             <p><em><b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</b></em></p>
             <p>My signature strength is kindness, followed by humor, creativity, curiosity and perspective. 
              Kindness: Doing favors and good deeds for others; helping them; taking care of them.
              Humor:Liking to laugh and tease; bringing smiles to other people; seeing the light side; making (not necessarily telling) jokes.
              Creativity:Thinking of novel and productive ways to conceptualize and do things; includes artistic achievement but is not limited to it.
              Curiosity:Taking an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake; finding subjects and topics fascinating; exploring and discovering.
              Perspective: Being able to provide wise counsel to others; having ways of looking at the world that make sense to oneself/others.
              </p>
             <p><em><b>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b></em></p>
             <p>I have spurts of intense productivity, where I feel super human and get so much done in a day, then I get burn out. I need to make sure that I plan and prioritise, but also remember that resting isn’t failing. </p>
