       <b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three new things I've learned about myself and my ego, one thing would be one of my key motivators is competition, if someone shares work it is motivation for me to make mine even better, whether it be the design, experience or the code, but all of those are subjective and only satiate my own ego</p>
      <p>Another thing is being quiet when asked questions in home group out of fear I am wrong and embarass myself in front of my cohort</p>
      <p>A third thing is being worried about working with others, I really enjoy this but what worries me is messing up and causing issues for them, or not being on the same level as others</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Values, empathy, and self-awareness play crucial roles in both learning and programming. Values provide a moral compass, guiding programmers to make ethical decisions and prioritize principles such as honesty, integrity, and respect for users' privacy and security. Empathy allows programmers to understand the needs and perspectives of users, enabling them to create user-friendly and inclusive software. By cultivating self-awareness, programmers can reflect on their strengths, weaknesses, and biases, leading to continuous self-improvement and a deeper understanding of their impact on the software development process. These qualities contribute to the creation of high-quality, ethically-driven software that meets the needs of users and promotes positive outcomes in the technological landscape.

        <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think that sprint 3 was really enjoyable for me and that sentiment wasn't shared across the cohort. Karma kicked in once I did sprint 4 and 5 though lol</p>
      <p>
        <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Easily following the instructions, I do much better with videos rather than reading. I like to having reading instructions to refer back to but seeing theory put into practice helps me a lot more.

        <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        So we don't become incels. Na jokes, while skills are key for being a programmer, being able to work in a team and have soft skills is equally important. We need to be able to work with future colleagues and be the best team members ever!

        <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is definately not a waste of time! For me personally, I see the value but because of my current job I have done a lot of this mahi already. I have been using it as a refresher and to catch any gaps so I can work on them. Things like asking questions, discussing problems and problem solving techniques so you feel less alone is something I started pushing my current team to do as their manager.
