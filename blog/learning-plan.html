      <h2>Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
      <p>
        <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create a business based around a few ideas I have, these are programs that are aiming to facilitate behavior change and improve outdated approaches to some industries. I have just landed a new job where they are developing an app and launching it as a business, I am hoping to be an active part of this journey and that my skills from dev academy can be used in launching this new product. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My limitations were taking on too many projects and prioritizing my social life over learning. I am happy to say that both of these have massively chilled out! 
        My limitations for boot camp will be keeping up with the program, starting a new job the same week boot camp starts means I will have to double the learning and my anxiety could skyrocket. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest challenges are easy to know, it will be staying on top of material and keeping focused for nine weeks while managing day to day life, full time work, recovery! 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to see my giving and receiving feedback develop, not just from facilitators but also my cohort. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been lucky enough to have Lani as my foundations facilitator, she has been caring and her feedback has been really helpful. I really hope the firm but fair approach is used, that the understanding continues e.g. if you’re sick, you can get an extension. 
        Just support and encouragement really! Like it has been for foundations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b>
      </p>
      <p>If I am stuck for longer than 30mins, I need to share via discord and also take a break. Meditate for a few minutes if needed to keep my stress levels down. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I would like my schedule to look like this:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Every Sunday:</b>Week ahead planning across work, study and personal life. Noting down any important dates e.g. birthdays, dinner dates or social commitments. I also need to prioritise house chores and submit any assignments. </p>
      <p><b>Each week day:</b>Early AM: Morning walk, yoga and set intention for the day. Plan and pack meals if going into the office. </p>
      <p><b>9-5:</b>This is work time, I am allowed to make exceptions if I have a slower work day and this cannot interrupt the flow of my job. During this time, I also need to go to the gym or exercise in some way. </p>
      <p><b>5pm onwards:</b>This is study time, some days I will need to cook dinner and do the dishes, so that means later nights at least 3 times per week (max 10.30pm). </p>
      <p><b>Weekends:</b>Saturday mornings are for cleaning and breakfast dates with my wife, from 10am onwards study is the priority. </p>


      <h2>Foundations learning plan</h2>
      <p><em><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></em></p>
      <p>There are a few parts to this. I would like to change careers, moving out of social media to a more hands-on role where I can build stuff daily, and also have more freedom to work wherever I like. I would also create apps that I have planned. The dream is to develop these and create companies I can grow then sell so I can retire by 40.</p>
      <p><em><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b></em></p>
      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Natural problem solver, I will seek the answer through research, try and fail, etc. I also love to learn, so it doesn’t take much motivation for me to start exploring something new.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> I tend to take on many projects and learn things at the same time, which causes burnout. I also prioritize my social life over learning, but this is slowly changing.</p>
      <p><em><b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></em></p>
      <p>Asking questions. I am never afraid to ask questions, but I find they just don’t pop into my mind when someone says “any questions.” I process on my own and at my own pace. This is from years of studying on my own (and via distance).</p>
      <p><em><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program.</b></em></p>
      <p>Each weekday, I commit to at least 1 hour after work hours of study. This usually becomes much longer; however, if my house isn’t in order, I will do washing, make dinner, give my cat some attention, etc. My weekends are dedicated to study unless I have a prebooked engagement, which means I adjust the weekday study sessions to make sure I have plenty of time to complete the work. When things are building up, that’s when I need to cancel social plans and prioritize, calling on my partner for support (they can take care of day-to-day life things). I also divide my study requirements into clear time slots, making sure I stick to them in order to complete the work on time.</p>
      <p><em><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</b></em></p>
      <p>- Stay up to date on study tasks and ask for help.</p>
      <p>- If something isn’t working, take a break, then review the work.</p>
      <p>- Take advantage of Google to fix a problem.</p>
      <p><em><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</b></em></p>
      <p>I expect constructive feedback, easy communication, and understanding that life gets in the way sometimes, glitches, or sickness, etc.</p>
      <p><em><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</b></em></p>
      <p>Weekdays typically look like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5.30am: Wake up + stretches</li>
        <li>6am: Breakfast + lunch prep + get ready</li>
        <li>7-8am: Start work</li>
        <li>12.15-1.30pm: Gym</li>
        <li>5pm: Head home</li>
        <li>5.15pm: Study</li>
        <li>7pm: Dinner</li>
        <li>8pm: Study</li>
        <li>9.30pm: Bed</li>
      </ul>
