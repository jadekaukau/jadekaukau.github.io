            <h5>Sprint 2</h5>
            <p><em><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></em>
            <p>There are a few parts to this, I would like to change careers, moving out of social media to a more hands on role where I can build stuff daily, and also have more freedom to work wherever I like. 
              I would also create apps that I have planned, the dream is to develop these and create companies I can grow then sell so I can retire by 40. 
              </p>
            <p><em><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </b></em></p>
            <p>Strengths: Natural problem solver, I will seek the answer through research, try and fail etc. I also love to learn, so it doesn’t take much movativation for me to start exploring something new. 
              Limitations: I tend to take on many projects and learning things at the same time, which causes burn out. I also do put my social life before learning, but this is slowly changing.
              </p>
            <p><em><b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></em></p>
            <p>Asking questions, I am never afraid to ask the questions but I find they just don’t pop into my mind when someone says “any questions”. I process on my own and at my pace, this is from years of study on my own (and via distance). </p>
            <p><em><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            </b></em></p>
            <p>Each week day, I commit to at least 1 hour after work hours of study.  This usually becomes much longer,  however I find that if my house isn’t in order I will do washing, make dinner, give my cat some attention etc. 
              My weekends are dedicated to study unless I have a prebooked engagement, which means I adjust the week day study sessions to make sure I have heaps of time to complete the work.
              When things are building up, that’s when I need to cancel social plan and prioritise, calling on my partner for support (they can take care of day to day life thunigs). I also chop my study requirements into clear time slots, making sure I stick to them in order to complete the work on time. </p>
            <p><em><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </b></em></p>
            <p>Stay up to date on study tasks and ask for help 
              If something isn’t working, take a break then review the work
              Take advantage of google to fix a problem 
              </p>
            <p><em><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
            </b></em></p>
            <p>I expect constructive feedback, easy communication and understanding that life gets in the way sometimes, glitches or sickness etc.</p>
            <p><em><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in</b></em></p>
            <p>Weekdays typically look like this: 
              -5.30am: Wake up + stretches
              -6am: Breakfast + lunch prep + get ready
              
              
              - 7-8am: Start work
              -12.15 - 1.30pm: Gym
