      <p>
        Kia ora non-techy friend, here are some of the ways I've faced problems that you might find handy at some point in your future. 
      </p>
      <h2>Being blocked on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
      <b>The problem:</b>
      I have found that throughout my coursework, I rush through tasks and don't read instructions properly.
      <b>How did I tackle this:</b>
      It's still an on-going challenge, but I started adding each task to a kanban board and also discussing with course buddies to see where they landed. It was really helpful to clarify and compare my understanding to theirs while keeping track of my progress. Comparing code was also helpful, seeing where I landed vs where they did. 
      <b>My vibes throughout the process:</b>
      Grumpy! When I learn, i can get confused and frustrated so processing this with other people helps a lot.
      <b>What I learned:</b> 
      Slow down. Read through instructions more than once. Changing environment helps, I have been doing a lot of coursework from my bed because of recovery, so when I was able, moving to a desk made me feel a little more calm and in the right problem solving headspace. 
      </p>

      <h2>Eleganty solved a problem</h2>
      <p>
        <b>The problem: </b>
        Dear non-techy friend, I had an issue with my javascript-kata exercises. I truly did not understand how I was supposed to go about the exercise. It was like I had forgotten all of my learning.
        <b>How did I tackle this:</b>
        I leaned on my trusted friend, freecodecamp. I did a few exercises to get my motor running and feel confident. Then with each exercise I wrote out in plain language what I needed to do so it made sense.
        <b>My vibes during the process:</b>
        Calm and trusting of the process. 
        <b>What I learned:</b>
        It is important to keep learning every day, even if you've had an operation, just try jump on for 10mins a day and use tools or programmes from past challenges to brush up on knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>My confidence using the below problem solving techniques</h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <ls>Pseudocode:This is my favourite and what I naturally do in my day to day life. It's creating a step by step process, sometimes with visuals that help understand what I need to do.
        </ls>
        Trying something: I do this often using freecodecamp, giving things a go helps solidify ideas.
        Rubber ducky method: I don't use this, I would prefer trying to teach others that can give a reaction. 
        Reading error messages: Not confident with these, sometimes I can find info on these in our discord or online, but they're not always simple to follow. 
        Console.logging: I really need to work on this, I see it's value but I don't enjoy using it. 
        Googling: This is probably the technique I use the most, I try to find videos, discussions in forums to see how others have tackled similar problems.
        Asking your peers for help: This technique I am developing and I am very proud of that. 
        Asking coaches for help: I feel like I do this a lot now, leaning on Lani to help provide guidance. 
        Improving your process with reflection: I enjoy reflection but don't naturally build it into my mahi, if I wasn't reminded via coursework I would forget. I think in a working environment I am better having retrospectives in collaboration with a team. 
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this course, I would've considered myself a lone wolf that never engages with others on coursework, including teachers. Foundations has taught me a lot and brought me out of my shell, I think I was worried about coming across as stupid or interuppting the flow of learning. During bootcamp, I want to be that person who asks all the questions and bother everyone because it means I am truly thinking about what is going on.
